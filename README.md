This is my senior year project involving opinion mining and sentimental analysis as part of the academic requirement for my Bachelor of Engineering(Computer Science) degree.
Features to be highlighted include a dynamic sentiment lexicon that evolves according to input data and efficent handling of the large amount of user data from the internet.

Process Flow:

Crawling Tweets -> Preprocessing -> Storage -> Training -> Build Classifier -> Test/Learning -> Display on GUI


TODO:
- Database component (Currently using txt flat file to store tweets)
- Sentiment Analysis component (Ensemble classification methods, Training models)
- Graphical front-end to show the results of the classification
