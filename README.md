This is my senior year project involving opinion mining and sentimental analysis as part of the academic requirement for my Bachelor of Engineering(Computer Science) degree.
Features to be highlighted include a dynamic sentiment lexicon that evolves according to input data and efficent handling of the large amount of user data from the internet.

Process Flow:

Crawling Tweets -> Preprocessing -> Storage -> Training -> Build Classifier -> Test/Learning -> Display on GUI


TODO:
- Sentiment Analysis component (Ensemble classification methods, Training models)
- Develop dynamic sentiment lexicon by referencing custom corpora construction.
- Graphical front-end to show the results of the classification(pywebview, chartjs, bootstrap) *if possible
