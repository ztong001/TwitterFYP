This is my senior year project involving opinion mining and sentimental analysis as part of the academic requirement for my Bachelor of Engineering(Computer Science) degree.
Features to be highlighted include a dynamic sentiment lexicon that evolves according to input data and efficent handling of the large amount of user data from the internet.

TODO:
- Database component
- Sentiment Analysis component (Ensemble classification methods, Training models)
- Graphical front-end to show the results of the classification

Current error with DB portion: 
- Error: <class 'TypeError'>

od exists.
